# AntiAFK

A lightweight and basic script, that prevents being kicked due to inactivity from most games.

## Installation

You can check out the latest releases [here](https://github.com/TheTrueHonker/AntiAFK/releases).   
Just start the executable and you are good to go.

## Usage

### Using the executable

After you started the executable, you have some seconds before the Anti-AFK procedure begins.  
If you want to exit the script, you can either close the window or press 'ESC'.

### Using the Script

If you want to use the script rather then the executable, you must download the project and run the following commands in your console, after you installed [Python 3](https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.0/).

```bash
$ pip install pynput
$ pip install argparse
$ python AAFK.py
```

You can view the available options by running this command in your console:
```
$ python AAFK.py -h
```
